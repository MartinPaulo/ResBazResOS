# Plan for ResBaz

I’m going to simply plunder the existing course material to create a new one. If this one works, I’ll backport 
the changes to the existing course. It seems like the fastest way of doing this.

##The running order is:

✓ Instructor introduces himself to the audience

✓ The line checklist (a short story about checklists)

✓ Launch your free PC! (with a basic checklist)

What you’ve just done:

* ✓ Project Trials
* ✓ Why you want to not leave your PC running (trial project limits)

✓ Kill your free PC (without a checklist - challenge!).

✓ Why do you care about your free PC? 

* ✓ The two researchers,
* ✓ a place to try your new skills...

✓ Ok: What’s a security group?

✓ Create a security group using a checklist

✓ But how do you manage your free PC?

✓ Intro to ssh and keys

✓ Create a KeyPair using a checklist

✓ Fire up a new instance using your security group and key pair.

Ssh into your instance

Upgrade and update your instance

✓ The Object Store: your free USB on the cloud (ditch if time is an issue?)

✓ How to get help on the cloud

Where to go from here…

* Allocations
* The full course
* NeCTAR’s online training.
    
Kill your PC!

The where to go from here will be a plug for the full course. Also to provide links to the NeCTAR online 
training I’ve now sat through.  I thought that the online training could be a page/pdf of links on the drupal 
instance they have just fired up: they can download it and have it on their desktop for future use.
