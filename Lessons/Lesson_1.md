**Answer:** In 2001 a critical-care specialist at John Hopkins Hospital designed a checklist to prevent line 
infections. This is it!

Line infection steps have been known and taught for years. But frustratingly line infections still
happen. So the specialist gave this checklist to nurses and then asked them to observe the doctors for a 
month as they put lines into patients, and record how often they completed each step. 

In more than a third of patients, they skipped at least one of the steps.

The specialist then asked the nurses stop the doctors whenever a step was skipped.

The ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero. 

So why are you being shown a line infection checklist on a session about the research cloud?

This story inspired a software company to introduce a checklist for deploying applications into production.

The rate of problems encountered during deployment fell to zero.

So with that in mind we've prepared some checklists for you use to launch your free PC's on the Research Cloud. 

    Now stop, and ask the audience to pair up. 
    
    Then let them know that their pair is the people person they will turn to first for help if they
    have any problems with the lesson. They are only to put up red cards if both people are stuck.

## Trial Projects

-- *Slide End* --

The first time you log on to the Research Cloud dashboard, you get given a **free** trial project, with three-months 
worth of time if you run the largest computer you are allowed to on it all the time. 

So you've just launched a platform to publish your kitten research to the world using your trial project.

A project is really just a way to group people together and to set constraints on what operations they can do on 
the Research Cloud. You can belong to more than one. 

**NB** Demonstrate the project drop down to show that this is where you switch between projects. Call it the "project
drop down. Note that if this is your first time on the cloud you should only have one project. 

Ask anyone who has more than one project to hold up a red sticky note. You are hoping to see none...
Talk to them about what other projects are in their dashboard.
There is a strong possibility they might have exhausted their trial project...

If you only use your smallest computer for short periods of time, and **terminate** them religiously after 
each run, your trial project will last far longer. 

When your trial project has expired you can still log in to the dashboard to view and request 
a project allocation on the research cloud. You can even request to extend the duration of your
existing trial project.

Regardless of your path,  your trial project should give you the time to learn the Research Cloud ropes!

-- *Slide* --

## Question

What's your trial project lifetime?

1. for ever and ever after
1. three months from today
1. depends on how much I use it... 

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: C**

So always **terminate** your free computers once you've finished working with them. That way you can avoid the
asking for allocation extensions paperwork.

## Why do you care about this?

-- *Slide End* --

Two researchers at a well known University, who and which shall remain nameless to protect the innocent, needed to 
do some fairly complex statistical analysis. So out of their grant money they bought two powerful computers, at a 
cost of $10 000 per machine to run[ MatLab](http://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab/?nocookie=true) on. 

But on the first run, they found that the machines couldn’t work with their data sets. The machines were underpowered! 
They were forced to iteratively spend money on upgrading those machines, until finally, one was able to perform the 
required analysis. It had taken them 12 months from the date of purchase to get to this point.

If, instead of purchasing hardware, they had turned to the cloud, they would have been able to have had their initial 
machine running within minutes. 

If it was underpowered, they would have been able to upgrade it to a larger machine, again within a matter of minutes. 
They probably wouldn’t even have had to re-install the software.  

The really good news for researchers is that everyone with an AAF login can experience this game changer for themselves, 
at no cost: through the national Research Cloud (NeCTAR) project.

If Research Cloud had been around with their current funding model in place when those two researchers were setting up 
their project that’s $20 000 of grant money that could have been used elsewhere!

-- *Slide* --

## Question

Currently, how much does it cost a researcher to use the Research Cloud?

1. Gazillions!
1. Squillions!
1. Billions!
1. Some unknown $$!
1. It’s currently free **at the point of service**

-- *Slide End* --

---

**Answer E**

---

There's another powerful reason to use the Research Cloud: access to storage which is kept locally in Australia and 
available on the high speed [AARNET](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us) backbone. Think of it as a USB stick on
steroids!

And all of this is backed by a research facing organization that is not driven by profit.

But before you go rushing to the Research Cloud, you have to understand that the cloud
is a not quite the same as dedicated computer on your desktop! 

What we are going to do today is to give you enough information to get your own machines up and running on the 
Research Cloud, and importantly, where to go to learn the gotcha’s.

-- *Slide* --

## Security Groups

-- *Slide End* --


One of the things you needed to do in launching your free PC was to select a security group called 'http'.

Let's see if I can explain this step in a bit more detail.

A security group is a set of rules used to create a firewall for your computer in the cloud. 

-- *Slide* --

## What's a firewall?

1. A wall used to prevent the spread of fire
1. An attractive wall made from fire
1. Something that selects what network traffic that can pass
1. That what's built on top of an ice foundation

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer A and C**

Naturally, on the the Research Cloud a security group selects what network traffic that can pass.

    Try to draw the following on a white board as you talk...

How firewalls work is that network messages destined for a computer are broken up into packets. Once a packet
reaches a computer how does the computer know which application the packet is intended for? 

Well, the operating system allocates a different number to each running application. Then all network packets that
carry that number are sent to that application. This number is called a port number.

By default the firewall defined by a security group allows all outgoing network packets to pass, 
but blocks all incoming network packets. But you can open "ports" in the security group, hence allowing
inbound network packets with a matching port number through to the application on the instance.

    If you get lots of blank looks, the following twisted metaphor might help:
    
    Imagine that Australia was a computer: and that containers on ships heading to Australia were the network packets.
    And stretching the metaphor even more, that cities were applications. 
    
    If you can get your head around that tortured metaphor, then its easy. Each container has a port number painted on it.
    Then when the ship docks, customs will only allow those containers with the correct port number off of it.
    
    So what if each network packet also had an associated number indicating the destination application? Then the security
    group, acting as a customs officer, could reject all the packets that were not acceptable for a given application!
    
    Well, strange to say, each packet on the network gets given a port number, indicating the application it is intended
    to go to. And well known applications get well known port numbers. So web servers use port 80, for example.
    
    So simply put a security group allows you to define the port numbers that packets from the outside world must have if 
    they are going to be allowed to reach your cloud computer. 
    
    Any packets with a different port number don’t even make it to your machine. They are just thrown overboard!

Your trial project comes with several pre-configured security groups. But if you request a project via an allocation
you get no security group pre-configured for you. And what if you want to run an application that doesn't fit into
the predefined ones? Simple. 

You just have to define your own. And so that's what you'll do now. You are going to create a single security group
that allows traffic to reach two applications.

And of course we've created a checklist to guide you. This ones a little more formal.

-- *Slide* --

## Security Groups

Create a Security Group with the help of the security group checklist

* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = Help me!
* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = I'm ready to move on...

-- *Slide End* --

**NB** The same security group can be applied to many computers in your project.

**NB:** You can edit a security group at any time.  And the changes will immediately apply to all running virtual 
machines that have that security group applied.

**NB:** This also means that if you share security groups amongst VM’s, you have to be careful: if you change rules for 
one server, you might inadvertently break another.

-- *Slide* --

## Question

I change the rules in a security group by removing port 80 (http). Mysteriously a web server on another VM in the 
project stops "working". Could it be because:

1. The security group was shared with the other machine?
1. The web server inexplicably broke?
1. The other machine itself failed?
1. NeCTAR are experiencing a network problem?
1. All of the above... ☹

-- *Slide End* --

Walk through each option, describing how it could affect the instance you are trying to reach.

**Answer: E.** Yes, it’s true. The research cloud can experience network issues from time to time. 

-- *Slide* --

## Count of less than 30 security groups

Did anyone find out why this is in the checklist?

-- *Slide End* --

It's in the list because NeCTAR limit you to a maximum of 30. Which means that you have to share them around if
you have lots of instances!

-- *Slide* --

## HTTP vs HTTPS

Can anyone tell us about these two?

-- *Slide End* --

HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. All you need to know is that it is the way in which web pages are requested
from the server and transferred back to your computer. HTTPS simply appends "Secure" to the end of HTTP. It gives you
the guarantee that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. So HTTP means anyone between you and
the server can see what pages you are looking at, and their contents. HTTPS means that they only will know what site
you are visiting.

-- *Slide* --

## What is SSH?

Anyone? Please?

-- *Slide End* --

Secure Shell. We'll cover it shortly. Patience!

-- *Slide* --

## And CIDR?

(And no, it's not a drink!)

-- *Slide End* --

Classless Internet Domain Routing, a snazzy name for a way of specifying a range of internet addresses in 
one fell swoop.

## The Terminal 

-- *Slide* --

Your free PC on the cloud has no keyboard, monitor or mouse. Do you have any hope of installing or removing
software on it?

* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No, doom and gloom!
* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Somehow, somewhere, there is hope!

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** The Greens have it: there's always hope!

In the old days, because computing was so expensive, many people would share a single computer by means of terminals. 
A terminal was a keyboard and a screen, and many terminals could be attached to a single computer.
 
These terminals supported a basic text based interface that allowed you to do work on the computer it was attached to.

You'll be unsurprised to learn that with the passage of time, people wrote programs that emulated these terminals. So 
one computer could act as the terminal for another computer - or even itself!

So you can run a terminal application on your computer to do work on your own computer. You might recognize it as the
"Command Line"

Its very simple to run: and if you take the time to learn about it, all your friends will think you are a computer
guru!

But the main advantage for us is that your local terminal program can also be used to run a terminal on 
another computer. 

-- *Slide* --

## This is our magic

```bash
ssh
```

`ssh` stands for **s**ecure **sh**ell. 

-- *Slide End* --

    Try to draw the following on a white board as you talk...

It connects a terminal on one machine to another target machine, thus allowing 
you to use the text based interface on the target machine. It kind of teleports 
the target machine terminal to yours…

You can think of `ssh` as your cloud login command.

Which is why you've been seeing the `ssh` references in the security groups.

`ssh` uses public key cryptography to connect with the target machine. 

Which needs key pairs to work. 

-- *Slide* --

# Key Pairs

-- *Slide End* --

"What's a key pair?" I hear you not ask.

    Could the following also be demonstrated through a box and a lock?
    Or a paint video?

Ok way back when, in the olden days, say when Greece ruled the known universe, and say you were a wealthy merchant 
named Pem, lets agree that I borrowed a lot of money from you and then relocated to a remote city.

How would I know that the man in front of me claiming to be your emissary, now here to collect your cash for you, was 
the correct person?

And the answer used by some was ingenious. We’d take a clay seal and break it in half. I’d take half, you’d keep half. 
Your emissary would hand me the half of the seal that you’d given me and if it matched mine I’d hand the cash over. 
Obviously there is quite a lot of trust in the system. And you’d want to keep your half of the seal private: 
under lock and key. Me? Meh, not so much.

Keys are a very similar concept. They have two halves. Anything you encrypt with one half can be decrypted by anyone 
with the other half.

There's a special page on the research cloud dashboard that helps you to create key pairs. 
NeCTAR will keep one, the public key, and you will download the private key, the other half of the pair, 
to your local machine.

When NeCTAR fire up a machine for you, they inject the public key into your machine. 
Anyone with the private key will be able to communicate with and control that machine. 
Like the clay seals of yesteryear, you want to keep your private key in a secure location. 

And again, we've create a checklist to help you create a keypair.

# The object store

-- *Slide End* --

The *Object Store* is an ideal replacement for the usb sticks that some people tend to carry 
around with them: You can upload and download files to it from any browser: and you can keep those files private,
or share those files with the world if you want.

Some people even publish whole websites from the object store!
 
On top of that, any file that you give it is backed up in triplicate, and each of the the copies is monitored for 
degradation.

Any bit rot, and the faulty file is replaced with a good copy. 

-- *Slide* --

## The object store

On the NeCTAR dashboard what's its child tab called?

1. Directories
1. Loading
1. Containers
1. Boxes 

-- *Slide End* --

Please hold up a Red sticky note if you need help finding it
Otherwise, hold up your answer...

**A:** C: Containers.

There is some terminology that you need to know.

Files are called objects. Unsurprisingly, since it's called the objectore.
 
And objects go into containers.

And this tab is where you create containers, and then put files (or objects) into the containers.

It is a very, very simple interface. So simple it's actually clunky IMHO. 

Now for a challenge.

-- *Slide* --

## Save an image to the object store

Can you create a container named **resbaz 2016**
in the Object Store and upload a picture to it? 

**NB:** preserve the file extension as you name the object.

Once your done, can you delete it all?

-- *Slide End* --

Please hold up a Red sticky note if you need help
and a Green one once you are done.

-- *Slide* --

## Share an image

<div align="left">
▢ Create a container (make it public)<br/>
▢ Upload a picture into it <br/>
▢ Click on the resultant public link <br/>
▢ Append '/' and the object name to the browser address <br/>
▢ Do you see the image on your browser? <br/>
▢ Can you make it private? <br/>
▢ Can you still see the image in your browser? <br/>
</div>

-- *Slide End* --

Please hold up a Red sticky note if you need help
and a Green one once you are done.

-- *Slide* --

You mark a container as being public.

Which of the following are affected:

1. Just the first file in the container
1. None of the files in the container
1. The mittens of celestial kittens
1. All of the files in the container
1. The last file in the container

?

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:** D: all of the files in the container. So you need to use this feature with care!

Hopefully a new tab has opened, taking you to the homepage of the Research Cloud support site. 

The support site has loads of useful documentation. It has beginners guides, online training,
and knowledge bases.

Scroll down to see the quick links to all this goodness.

There's also a handy link that if followed tells you how to contact Support.

-- *Slide* --

## Question

Can you find the support email address?

Is it:

1. support@rc.nectar.org.au
1. help_me@rc.nectar.org.au
1. do_not_reply@rc.nectar.org.au 
1. the_big_boss@rc.nectar.org.au

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: A**

The support site is well worth exploring. But we are not going to do it now.
Remember, you now know where to go when you want to find helpful documentation.

-- *Slide* --

## Question

Can you find the NeCTAR training site?

Is its address in the browser:

1. https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au
1. https://support.nectar.org.au
1. http://www.nectar.org.au/ 
1. http://training.nectar.org.au/
1. http://status.rc.nectar.org.au/

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer:**

Those are all useful NeCTAR website addresses to know. Especially the status site.
But the answer is D, http://training.nectar.org.au/

This is where you can go once you return to your homes, and look to increase your understanding of
the Research cloud, the home of your free computer and usb stick!

**Activity:** Close the support tab of the browser.

**A:** Hold up a Red sticky note if you are not looking at the dashboard!

Between the two drop downs NeCTAR have placed an item titled "Support Ticket". This is
where you should first turn if you need help.

**Activity:** Get everyone to click on the "Support Ticket" link of the top bar of the dashboard.

The dialogue brought up has a search option. This allows you to try to find the answer to your problem
yourself before you reach out by completing the form.

-- *Slide* --

## Question

Try searching the knowledge base for "allocation".

What does an approved allocation request become?

1. a tenancy
1. a project
1. a collaboration
1. an empire
1. a task

-- *Slide End* --

**Answer: B**

Once you've done a search, if you still need help, just complete the fields in the dialog and 
submit your support request.

The one "gotcha" is the **default email address is the one shown in the dashboard settings drop down**. 

If you want responses to go to a different address, change it!

To close the dialogue without sending anything just click on the dashboard behind it.

**Activity:** Get people to close the dialog and return to the dashboard.

-- *Slide* --

## Allocations

Can you all find the Allocations tab?

* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No...
* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes!

-- *Slide End* --

*Allocations* is an important tab: Remember, once you’ve exhausted your trial project, this is where you come. 
It’s basically an online form that allows you to apply for a project with enough resources to support your research.  

-- *Slide* --

## Extend trial project

Is there an option to convert your trial project on the allocation form?

* <span style="color:red">&#9632;</span> = No!
* <span style="color:green">&#9632;</span> = Yes, I can see it.

-- *Slide End* --

Again, the greens have it.

You can also request to have your  project/tenant extended. 
You do this by selecting the "Convert project trial" option when filling in the allocation request form.

-- *Slide* --

You can think of the Dashboard we've just explored as the drivers seat for an entire Data Centre <br /> 
BUT it is a car you can crash! <br />
